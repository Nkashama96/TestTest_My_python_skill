Grocery Store needs your help with Inventory Summary

A grocery store manager wants to print a summary of the current stock for apples, bananas, and oranges. The summary should clearly state the number of each fruit in stock, using a single print statement and the format method.

Write a Python program that, given the number of apples, bananas, and oranges in stock, prints a summary in the following format:

    We have X apples, Y bananas, and Z oranges in stock.

Where X, Y, and Z are the respective counts.

Input: Three integer variables: apples, bananas, and oranges.

Output: Print the summary using the format method.


Example

If apples = 10, bananas = 12, and oranges = 12, the output should be:

    We have 10 apples, 12 bananas, and 12 oranges in stock.

# Given the number of apples, bananas, and oranges in stock, print a summary using the format method.

apples = 12
bananas = 8
oranges = 15

# TODO: Print the summary using the format method 
print(f"We have {apples} apples, {bananas} bananas, and {oranges} oranges in stock.")
